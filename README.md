# 🚶 Pedestrian Dynamics Modeling and Social Force Analysis Based on Object Detection

A novel framework that models complex pedestrian behaviors through object detection, social force modeling, and physics-inspired learning. This project integrates **Information-Geometric Variational Inference Framework (IGVIF)** and **Adaptive Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off Strategy (AEETS)** to enhance pedestrian detection, forecasting, and crowd dynamics understanding in densely populated urban environments.

---

## 🧠 Motivation

Understanding pedestrian dynamics is essential for safe urban mobility, autonomous navigation, and crowd management. Traditional object detection methods struggle under real-world challenges such as:

- Occlusions in dense crowds  
- Multi-scale temporal variability  
- Dynamic interpersonal interactions  
- Nonlinear movement patterns  

This framework leverages tools from **information geometry**, **probabilistic inference**, and **adaptive optimization** to tackle these challenges from both a physical and statistical perspective.

---

## 🎯 Key Contributions

✅ Introduced **IGVIF**: A probabilistic inference framework grounded in information geometry for modeling latent pedestrian behavior  
✅ Proposed **AEETS**: An adaptive strategy balancing entropy-driven exploration and exploitation during optimization  
✅ Modeled **social forces** via learned interaction potentials embedded in the model  
✅ Achieved **state-of-the-art performance** on ETH/UCY trajectory benchmarks

## 📐 Core Components

### IGVIF: Information-Geometric Variational Inference Framework

- Encodes trajectory history into a **Riemannian latent space**
- Learns **multi-modal, hierarchical representations** of pedestrian intentions
- Optimized with **Fisher-Rao metric**, enabling more stable and interpretable variational updates

### AEETS: Adaptive Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off Strategy

- Uses **entropy measures** to adapt optimization dynamically  
- When uncertainty is high → exploration  
- When certainty is gained → exploitation  
- Enables **faster convergence** and avoids local minima traps

### Social Force Module

- Learns interpersonal attraction/repulsion patterns  
- Enhances realism of multi-agent interactions  
- Optional integration with environmental map constraints
